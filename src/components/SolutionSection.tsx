						We are committed to empowering rural-urban migrants in
						Rwanda by creating accessible learning hubs and
						skill-building opportunities that enable them to secure
						stable livelihoods in urban areas. Our mission is to
						bridge the gap between migration and employment by
						providing targeted training programs that equip migrants
						with the practical skills needed in the job market. We
						also aim to raise funds to offer financial support to
						those who cannot afford the cost of these courses,
						ensuring that everyone, regardless of their financial
						situation, has the opportunity to thrive in urban
						environments. By connecting migrants with the resources
						they need to build their skills and confidence, we are
						helping them break the cycle of poverty and create
						better futures for themselves and their families
